To build and install the game, get the Simple DirectMedia Layer
library from http://libsdl.org and install
it.  Then run:
	./configure; make; make install

If you are building with Visual C++, unpack VisualC.zip and open
the VC++ project file found in the new "VisualC" directory.

If you are porting Maelstrom to a new platform or build system, the
following options may be passed to the preprocessor.

* DATADIR  default search directory for game data files. Defaults to './'.

* SAMPLING_RATE  audio playback sampling rate, game audio is stored at 11025Hz,
                 and resampled when loaded at runtime.  Defaults to 11025.

* AUDIO_BUFFER_SIZE  size of audio buffers, increasing buffer size increases latency.
                     For mono audio at 11025Hz a size of 256 is recommended;
		      increase linearly. Defaults to 256.
